## üõ†Ô∏è Approach & Architecture

The solution is built using:

- **FastAPI** for the web interface
- **Sentence Transformers** for embeddings
- **ChromaDB** for vector-based search
- **Hugging Face Transformers** for summarization and Q&A
- **HTML/JS UI** with a tabbed layout

### Workflow

1. **Data Ingestion**: Parses `.json` email/calendar + `.md` notes
2. **Embedding & Indexing**: Semantic vector store with Chroma
3. **Summarization**: Daily overview generated using `distilbart-cnn`
4. **RAG-based QA**: Contextual answers from your own work history
5. **Frontend**: Simple tabbed UI (Summary, Calendar, Notes + Ask)
